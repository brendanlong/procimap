Preparations
============
You may have to edit some global variables *before* you install the package.
If you are on Windows, you might want to set

DEFAULT_PAGER = 'more' in ProcImap/ImapMailbox.py, and
STANDARD_IMAPLIB = True in ProcImap/ImapServer.py

Make sure that you have a working python environment. Preferrably, get
Python from www.python.org. The Enthought Edition of Python on Windows
is broken! At least last time I tried it.


Installation into your Python distro
====================================
To install the ProcImap package, run
'python setup.py install'
with sufficient privileges (i.e. as root on linux)


Usage
=====
If you have run the installation successfuly, the ProcImap package will
be available in Python. Start programming! For examples, look in the
example directory. If you want to run this as a replacement for procmail,
have a look at examples/process_emails.py.
